Traditional German weather houses are small, decorative structures that are popular in Germany and other parts of Europe. They are often made from wood and feature a small door that opens to reveal a figure inside. These figures are usually a man and a woman, and they are used to predict the weather. This github is part of a post on [Digital Urban](http://) which details an updated version.

## Parts

The Weather House requires:

1. A Pi Pico W
2. A [360 Degree Non-Continous Servo](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/geekservo-building-bricks-360-degree-servo?variant=40401223778387)
3. An [8 Pixel NeoPixel Strip](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-neopixel-stick?variant=370777247)
4. A Single Neopixel
5. Access to a 3D Printer and Laser Cutter

The design is hopefully self explanatary  - the single neopixel goes in the top, above the servo.

The LED strip goes under the 3D printed enclosure to light up the Weather House. If you only want to show the weather as a symbol the lighting is optional.

## The Case

Files are provided to laser cut, it is sized to fit on sheets of A4 material.

The enclousure to hold the components in place are 3D printed. 

The whole design is also provided as a Fusion 360 file to edit accordingly.

Created as part of work at the [Connected Environments Group at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://connected-environments.org/), University College London.
